      <title>Deep Analysis of  TiO2 Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we perform a theoretical investigation using the density functional tight binding (DFTB) approach for the structural analysis and electronic structure of anatase, brookite and rutile phase TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). Our results show that the number of Ti-O bonds is more than that of O-O while the number of Ti-Ti bonds are the less. Thus, large amount of O atoms prefers to connect to Ti atoms. The increase in the temperature of the NPs contributes to an increase in the interaction of Ti–O bonding, but a decrease in the O-O bonding. The segregation of Ti and O atoms shows that Ti atoms tend to co-locate at the center, while O atoms tend to reside on the surface. Increasing temperature causes decrease of the bandgap from 3.59 to 2.62 eV for brookite phase, which is much more energetically favorable compared to bulk while it could increase the bandgap from 3.15 to 3.61 eV for anatase phase. For three phase TiO2 NPs, LUMO and Fermi levels decrease. The HOMO level of anatase phase NP decrease, but it increases for brookite and rutile phase TiO2 nanoparticles. Herein, an increase in the temperature contributes to the stabilization of anatase phase TiO2 NP due to decrease in the HOMO energies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>R Package</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we introduced the DCEM package for clustering big data. DCEM is developed using R and is publically accessible on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at &lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/&#34;&gt;https://CRAN.R-project.org/&lt;/a&gt;. In particular we demonstrated that significant improvements in run time and number of iterations are achieved by embedding a heap structure within the framework of the traditional expectation maximisation algorithm Dempster et al. (1977). Our package makes use of the proposed data driven approach Kurban, Jenne, and Dalkilic (2016b) that, (1) avoids visiting all data and, (2) avoid continually re-visiting the data, to speed up the convergence process. We illustrated the practical utility of DCEM by performing several experiments across application domains that highlight the significant improvement in performance. In future, we would like to 1) extend this approach to use data structures that enforce total ordering for example, kd-tree. Min heap is a partially ordered structure and hence does not enforece a strict oredering on the data. We argue that by using a totally ordered structure, we can further improve the performance of iterative learning algorithms, 2) use this approach in contemporary iterative data mining algorithms i.e., k-means, an example of such work is also discussed in Kurban and Dalkilic (2017).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Structural Analysis</title>
      <link>https://hasankurban.netlify.app/project/m1-project/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to conduct structural analysis, we also developed programs in R language  to analyze the number of bonds, segregation phenomena, and RDF. We perform a theoretical investigation using the density functional tight binding (DFTB) approach for the structural analysis and electronic structure of copper hydride (CuH) metallic nanoparticles (NPs) of different size (from 204 to 2418 atoms). By increasing the size of CuH NPs, the number of bonds, segregation phenomena and radial distribution function (RDF) of binary Cu-Cu, Cu-H and H-H interactions are investigated using new algorithms. The results reveal that the number of bonds Cu-Cu is larger than that of Cu-H while H2 bonds are the smallest. Thus, the ability of Cu atoms to absorb large amounts of H is more than H2. The increase in the size of the NPs contributes to the stabilization because of the enhanced strength of H–H bonding. The segregation of Cu and H atoms show that Cu atoms tend to co-locate at the center, while H atoms tend to reside on the surface. From the density of state (DOS) analysis, CuH NPs shows a metallic character which is compatible with experimental data. HOMO and Fermi levels decrease from -3.555 to -3.443 eV and from -3.510 to -3.441 eV. Herein, an increase in the size contributes to the stabilization of CuH NP due to decrease in the HOMO energies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Public Transportation Optimization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using a large volume of bus data in the form of GPS coordinates (over 100 million data points) and automated
passenger count data (over 1 million data points) we have developed (1) a system of analysis and prediction of future public transportation demand (2) a new model that uses concepts specific to college campuses that maximizes passenger satisfaction. Using these concepts we improve service of a model college public transportation service and more specifically the Indiana University Campus Bus Service (IUCBS).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Iterative Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://hasankurban.netlify.app/project/kmeans-project/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we have described an optimization approach that can be used over any iterative optimization
algorithms to improve their training run-time complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that theoretically shows convergence of iterative algorithms over heap structure–instead of over a cost function. This approach is tested over k-means (KM) and expectation-maximization algorithm (EM-T). The experimental results show dramatic improvements over KM and EM-T training run-time through different kinds of testing: scale, dimension, and separability. Regarding cluster error, the traditional algorithms’ and our
extended algorithms’ performances are similar. For future work, clearly one obvious step is to add seeding to KM* drawing from both k-means++ and kd trees. Additionally,we are interested in the broader question of this approach to iterative converging algorithms. Further, are there better structures than heaps? Lastly, parallelization offers some new challenges, but also opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Clustering Big Data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Existing data mining techniques, more particularly iterative learning algorithms, become overwhelmed with big data. While parallelism is an obvious and, usually, necessary strategy, we observe that both (1) continually
revisiting data and (2) visiting all data are two of the most prominent problems especially for iterative, unsupervised algorithms like Expectation Maximization algorithm for clustering (EM-T). Our strategy is to embed EM-T into a non-linear hierarchical data structure (heap) that allows us to (1) separate data that needs to be revisited from data that does not and (2) narrow the iteration toward the data that is more difficult to cluster. We call this extended EM-T, EM*. We show our EM* algorithm outperform EM-T algorithm over large real world and synthetic data sets. We lastly conclude with some theoretic underpinnings that explain why EM* is successful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The challenges presented by data to scientific inquiry and hypothesis testing in an oceanographic setting
are not new problems. Indeed, the challenges are at least a century old. The problems are not with the data itself, but rather with the attention to the management of the “data ecology” in the information systems. Data needs to be accessible as an input to scientific inquiry—a requirement that goes far beyond simply centralizing the available data. Our research focuses on the development of a proofof-concept system that properly handles an information ecology. The power of such a strong foundation is then demonstrated in two ways: (1) through our data driven hypothesis generation system, built and employed for analysis of the relationship between coral disease and temperature in the Caribbean; (2) through programmatic search for patterns and anti-patterns that verify, falsify, or demonstrate no discernible relationship for a set of
variants on a particular temperature–disease hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Random Forest</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Random Forests have been used as effective ensemble models for classification. We present in this paper a new type of Random Forests (RFs) called Red(uced)-RF that adopts a new dynamic data reduction principle and a new voting mechanism called Priority Vote Weighting (PV) which improve accuracy, execution time and AUC values compared to Breiman’s RF. Red-RF also shows that the strength of a random forest can increase without noticeably increasing correlation between the trees. We then compare performance of Red-RF and Breiman’s RF in 8 experiments that involve classification problems with datasets of different sizes. Finally, we conduct two additional experiments that involve considerably larger datasets with one million points in each.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dramatic increases in the amount and complexity of stellar data must be matched by new or refined algorithms that can help scientists make sense of this data and so better understand the universe. ParaHeap-k is a parallel cluster algorithm for analyzing big data that can potentially prove useful to astronomical research.&lt;/p&gt;
