      <title>Clustering Big Data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Existing data mining techniques, more particularly iterative learning algorithms, become overwhelmed with big data. While parallelism is an obvious and, usually, necessary strategy, we observe that both (1) continually
revisiting data and (2) visiting all data are two of the most prominent problems especially for iterative, unsupervised algorithms like Expectation Maximization algorithm for clustering (EM-T). Our strategy is to embed EM-T into a non-linear hierarchical data structure (heap) that allows us to (1) separate data that needs to be revisited from data that does not and (2) narrow the iteration toward the data that is more difficult to cluster. We call this extended EM-T, EM*. We show our EM* algorithm outperform EM-T algorithm over large real world and synthetic data sets. We lastly conclude with some theoretic underpinnings that explain why EM* is successful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Random Forest</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Random Forests have been used as effective ensemble models for classification. We present in this paper a new type of Random Forests (RFs) called Red(uced)-RF that adopts a new dynamic data reduction principle and a new voting mechanism called Priority Vote Weighting (PV) which improve accuracy, execution time and AUC values compared to Breiman’s RF. Red-RF also shows that the strength of a random forest can increase without noticeably increasing correlation between the trees. We then compare performance of Red-RF and Breiman’s RF in 8 experiments that involve classification problems with datasets of different sizes. Finally, we conduct two additional experiments that involve considerably larger datasets with one million points in each.&lt;/p&gt;
