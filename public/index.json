Our results show that the number of Ti-O bonds is more than that of O-O while the number of Ti-Ti bonds are the less. Thus, large amount of O atoms prefers to connect to Ti atoms. The increase in the temperature of the NPs contributes to an increase in the interaction of Ti–O bonding, but a decrease in the O-O bonding. The segregation of Ti and O atoms shows that Ti atoms tend to co-locate at the center, while O atoms tend to reside on the surface. Increasing temperature causes decrease of the bandgap from 3.59 to 2.62 eV for brookite phase, which is much more energetically favorable compared to bulk while it could increase the bandgap from 3.15 to 3.61 eV for anatase phase. For three phase TiO2 NPs, LUMO and Fermi levels decrease. The HOMO level of anatase phase NP decrease, but it increases for brookite and rutile phase TiO2 nanoparticles. Herein, an increase in the temperature contributes to the stabilization of anatase phase TiO2 NP due to decrease in the HOMO energies.\n","date":1587513600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587513600,"objectID":"535a32dcfccc9f1900e797c9fd457746","permalink":"/project/to/","publishdate":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/to/","section":"project","summary":"DFTB calculations","tags":["Data Science","Data Analysis","DFTB","Nanoparticles","Material Science"],"title":"Deep Analysis of  TiO2 Nanoparticles","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this paper we introduced the DCEM package for clustering big data. DCEM is developed using R and is publically accessible on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at https://CRAN.R-project.org/. In particular we demonstrated that significant improvements in run time and number of iterations are achieved by embedding a heap structure within the framework of the traditional expectation maximisation algorithm Dempster et al. (1977). Our package makes use of the proposed data driven approach Kurban, Jenne, and Dalkilic (2016b) that, (1) avoids visiting all data and, (2) avoid continually re-visiting the data, to speed up the convergence process. We illustrated the practical utility of DCEM by performing several experiments across application domains that highlight the significant improvement in performance. In future, we would like to 1) extend this approach to use data structures that enforce total ordering for example, kd-tree. Min heap is a partially ordered structure and hence does not enforece a strict oredering on the data. We argue that by using a totally ordered structure, we can further improve the performance of iterative learning algorithms, 2) use this approach in contemporary iterative data mining algorithms i.e., k-means, an example of such work is also discussed in Kurban and Dalkilic (2017).\n","date":1587340800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587340800,"objectID":"26a124ac715da52c114744abe6bf3e9a","permalink":"/project/package-project/","publishdate":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/package-project/","section":"project","summary":"Data Clustering with EM (DCEM) for Big Data, an R package","tags":["Unsupervised Learning","Clustering","Big Data","Expectation Maximization","Data Mining","Heap","R programming"],"title":"R Package","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mustafa Kurban","Hasan Kurban","Mehmet Dalkilic"],"categories":null,"content":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\n","date":1577664000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577664000,"objectID":"3742144273d046babcfc4713e97a2747","permalink":"/publication/jm3/","publishdate":"2019-12-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jm3/","section":"publication","summary":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.","tags":null,"title":"Controlling structural and electronic properties of ZnO NPs: Density-functional tight-binding method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mustafa Kurban","Hasan kurban"],"categories":null,"content":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\n","date":1577664000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577664000,"objectID":"3442ff8dd2ead02909c47bbff50469c0","permalink":"/publication/cm2/","publishdate":"2019-12-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cm2/","section":"publication","summary":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.","tags":null,"title":"Study of Structural and Optoelectronic Properties of Hexagonal ZnO Nanoparticles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hasan Kurban","Mustafa Kurban","Mehmet Dalkilic"],"categories":null,"content":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\n","date":1569456000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569456000,"objectID":"768a176ecf2232e17c7b51993a14edfa","permalink":"/publication/jm1/","publishdate":"2019-09-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jm1/","section":"publication","summary":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.","tags":null,"title":"Density-functional tight-binding approach for the structural analysis and electronic structure of copper hydride metallic nanoparticles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hasan Kurban","Mustafa Kurban","Mehmet Dalkilic"],"categories":null,"content":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\n","date":1569456000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569456000,"objectID":"c5c254b37ba53d2c52471451e3895a00","permalink":"/publication/jm2/","publishdate":"2019-09-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jm2/","section":"publication","summary":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.","tags":null,"title":"Size Dependent Electronic Structure and Structural Properties of Cupric Oxide (CuO) NanoParticles","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In order to conduct structural analysis, we also developed programs in R language to analyze the number of bonds, segregation phenomena, and RDF. We perform a theoretical investigation using the density functional tight binding (DFTB) approach for the structural analysis and electronic structure of copper hydride (CuH) metallic nanoparticles (NPs) of different size (from 204 to 2418 atoms). By increasing the size of CuH NPs, the number of bonds, segregation phenomena and radial distribution function (RDF) of binary Cu-Cu, Cu-H and H-H interactions are investigated using new algorithms. The results reveal that the number of bonds Cu-Cu is larger than that of Cu-H while H2 bonds are the smallest. Thus, the ability of Cu atoms to absorb large amounts of H is more than H2. The increase in the size of the NPs contributes to the stabilization because of the enhanced strength of H–H bonding. The segregation of Cu and H atoms show that Cu atoms tend to co-locate at the center, while H atoms tend to reside on the surface. From the density of state (DOS) analysis, CuH NPs shows a metallic character which is compatible with experimental data. HOMO and Fermi levels decrease from -3.555 to -3.443 eV and from -3.510 to -3.441 eV.

This approach is tested over k-means (KM) and expectation-maximization algorithm (EM-T). The experimental results show dramatic improvements over KM and EM-T training run-time through different kinds of testing: scale, dimension, and separability. Regarding cluster error, the traditional algorithms’ and our extended algorithms’ performances are similar. For future work, clearly one obvious step is to add seeding to KM* drawing from both k-means++ and kd trees.

Our strategy is to embed EM-T into a non-linear hierarchical data structure (heap) that allows us to (1) separate data that needs to be revisited from data that does not and (2) narrow the iteration toward the data that is more difficult to cluster.
