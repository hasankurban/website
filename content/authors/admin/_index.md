My research and teaching interests include machine learning, data mining, big data, data science and artificial intelligence. During my PhD, I found the opportunity to study machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM) algorithms theoritacally in depth and my doctoral thesis was about an optimization framework designed to improve ML and DM algorithms from a data centric perspective over big data. I have  published various peer-reviewed articles and taught several graduate and undergraduates classes  regarding those disciplines. In my professionel life  I  enjoy building intelligent systems to find data-driven solutions to real-world problems.
