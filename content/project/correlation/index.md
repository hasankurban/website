In this work, we analyse the correlations between structural and electronic properties of anatase, brookite and rutile phases TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) using data science techniques. For this purpose, we use the geometries of three phases TiO2 NPs under heat treatment obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the frame of DFTB+ code. We investigate the relationships among electronic properties of TiO2 and order parameter \left(\mathbit{R}\ \mathbit{or}\ \mathbf{segregation}\ \mathbf{phenomena}\right) & nearest number contacts \left(\mathbit{n}\right). In this architecture, the correlations among HOMO, LUMO, Energy gap \left(\mathbit{E}_\mathbit{g}\right), Fermi energy \left(\mathbit{E}_\mathbit{f}\right), \mathbit{R} and \mathbit{n} have been analyzed. Our results show that there is a moderate negative correlation between \mathbit{R}_\mathbit{O} and \mathbit{E}_\mathbit{g} in the brookite and rutile phases, but a strong linear correlation between these two variables in the anatase phase. Additionally, in the brookite phase, the positive linear correlation between \mathbit{R}_{\mathbit{Ti}}\  and \mathbit{E}_\mathbit{g} is noteworthy. Moderate linear correlation was observed in the anatase phase and positive in the rutile phase. The positive linear dependence of \mathbit{n}_{\mathbit{O}-\mathbit{O}} and \mathbit{E}_\mathbit{g} in brookite phase is remarkable. No strong correlation was observed in any phase between \mathbit{n}_{\mathbit{Ti}-\mathbit{Ti}}\ and \mathbit{E}_\mathbit{g}. In the brookite phase,  \mathbit{n}_{\mathbit{O}-\mathbit{Ti}} has an almost perfect negative correlation with \mathbit{E}_\mathbit{g}.
